[PROJECT: FINAL PREPARATION]
        [1.] Look at previous API builds to see what my preferred format is
                * PNJSStudentAPI will be my baseline
                * I will use the previous projects resource files to start the server
                * I built a NodeJS mask for ease of use in the future
                * Created NodeJS mask for future projects
                |COMPLETE|
        [2.] index.html, styles.css, scripts.js insertion
                [1.] Create these files
                        * Ended up moving back-end files to API directory
                        * Ended up putting front-end files in Client directory
                        |COMPLETE|

[PROJECT: FINAL](
        [1.] Create a new application using previous projects or a template of my own making
                [1.] Provided ideas from course:
                        * A movie search database that includes a login
                        * A chat app using Socket.IO
                        * A shopping app with products that include a login
                        * A manager app that lets you add, remove, or delete data
                2. My application needs to consist of these minimums:
                        * A front-end user interface
                        * A back-end database
                        * Editable data
                        * A login mechanic
                [3.] My application ideas:
                        [1.] My own personal alarm app
                                * Maybe I could have it connect to YouTube to play audio?
                                * Normal functionality of an alarm
                                * Maybe puzzle solving?
                                [SEE: @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50v8s2CLV2o]
                        [2.] A calendar system
                                * Connect to Google Calendar?
                                * Normal functionality of a calendar

                        [3.] A discord note system
                                * Connect to Google Calendar?
                                * Would populate reminders
                                * Functions like a bot or something
